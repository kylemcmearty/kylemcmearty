## Hi there 👋

AI guy with 5 years enterprise production experience shipping 5 personalization products and 7 APIs.
https://www.ecrs.com/resources/library/p/ecrs-expands-artificial-intelligence-capabilities-in-ecommerce-with-personalization/

I like to consider myself a generalist with specialist skillsets.

My main focus is developing fullstack (business + development) AI solutions with Python and Typescript for web app development (Next.js).

Including:
  - Recommender Systems (Personalization)
  - Agentic AI Systems
  - Segmentation Systems
  - Forecasting

I think eventually AI Python people will converge on Typescript.
